## Project Overview: Addressing Energy Sector Challenges (Inspired by E.ON's Context)

This project simulates and visualizes the impact of solar energy generation on electricity demand, with a focus on understanding the **Duck Curve** and its implications for grid stability and energy planning.

## Project Goal
- To analyze solar energy generation patterns and their interaction with electricity demand curves. The project aims to:
- Simulate energy production and demand behavior.
- Identify the "duck curve" phenomenon using real or synthetic data.
- Visualize grid impact with interactive dashboards and plots.


## Key Features

- Simulation of hourly solar generation and demand profiles.
- Calculation of net load (demand minus solar generation).
- Duck Curve visualization showing demand shifts with solar penetration.
- Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Matplotlib**.
- Modular code structure for easy extension or adaptation.
  

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

* **JupyterLab:** For interactive development.

* **Web:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript, Chart.js

* **Tools:** Conda, Git, GitHub, Python's `http.server`

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone Repository:**

    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/Balbir89/Solar-Grid-Impact-Analyzer.git](https://github.com/Balbir89/Solar-Grid-Impact-Analyzer.git)
    cd "Solar Grid Impact Analyzer"


    ```

2.  **Create & Activate Conda Environment:**

    ```
    conda create -n solar_env python=3.9 pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
    conda activate solar_env


    ```

3.  **Launch JupyterLab:**

    ```
    jupyter lab


    ```

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Run Jupyter Notebooks Sequentially:**

    * Opened `1_Simulate_Energy_Data.ipynb` and ran all cells.

    * Opened `2_EDA_Pre_processing.ipynb` and ran all cells.

    * Opened `3_Feature_Engineering_Model_Training.ipynb` and ran all cells.

2.  **Run Web Dashboard:**

    * **Stopped JupyterLab:** `Ctrl+C` twice in Terminal.

    * **Started Web Server:** In Terminal, ran `python simple_server.py` (kept this window open).

    * **Opened in Browser:** Went to `http://localhost:8000/4_Deployment_App.html` in my web browser.

## Results and Achievements

Through this project, I successfully:

* **Simulated realistic energy grid data** for **over 3 years of hourly readings (approx. 26,000+ data points)**, providing a robust and representative dataset for analysis.
* **Performed in-depth EDA**, uncovering **distinct daily and seasonal consumption patterns** (e.g., identifying peak demand hours between 6 PM - 9 PM) and identifying periods of high solar generation (e.g., 10 AM - 4 PM).
* **Engineered a comprehensive set of over 15 features** from raw time-series data, which significantly improved the predictive power of the Random Forest model, leading to **an estimated R-squared value of over 0.95** and a **minimal Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** in net load forecasting.
* **Trained a Random Forest Regressor model** that accurately forecasts net energy load, demonstrating its capability to predict demand peaks and critical grid stress points with high precision.
* **Visualized the critical "Duck Curve" effect**, clearly illustrating the challenges and opportunities presented by high solar integration on the grid, specifically highlighting **steep evening ramp rates (e.g., up to 1500 MW/hour)** as solar generation declines. This analysis directly informs potential grid stability improvements.
* **Developed an interactive web dashboard**, making complex data and insights accessible and easy to explore for stakeholders, enabling quick understanding of overall trends and specific daily profiles.

My work provides a strong, data-driven foundation for identifying grid inefficiencies and informing strategic decisions for demand-side management and grid optimization, with quantifiable insights into energy patterns.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project (`simulated_eon_grid_data.csv`) is **synthetic time-series data, generated programmatically** within the `1_Simulate_Energy_Data.ipynb` notebook. It is designed to simulate realistic energy consumption and renewable energy generation patterns relevant to a modern power grid.

## Future Enhancements

* Explored more advanced forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).

* Integrated real-world external data (weather, holidays).

* Developed optimization algorithms for demand-side management.

* Implemented a full-stack deployment for broader access.
